# ICIPCovariance
Algorithm to reconstruct hyperspectral images from compressive measurements using a low-rank approximation of the covariance matrix. This repository also provides data adquired in laboratory

This repository provides the source code to reconstruct images from compressive data captured with DD-CASSI architecture. The test bed optical implementation is shown

To run this code, first download the sensing matrix from [link], and unzip the folder False_8 into "codigos" folder. Then run format_sensing_matrix to set up the sensing matrix. After that run reconstruct to show the reconstruction results.
